This folder contains the python scripts to launch on the remote server (TURPAN). 

These scripts are based on the notebooks in the trocr_handwritten/notebook folder, and use the functiosn contained in the trocr_handwritten/utils folder.

The use of notebooks is not recommended for production code, but they are very useful for experimentation.
