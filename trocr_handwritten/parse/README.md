## üì¶ Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the GitHub repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/handwrittenOCR/trocr_handwritten.git
```

### Step 2: Install Poetry
`Poetry` is a tool for dependency management in Python. Install it with the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the `trocr_handwritten` directory and install the dependencies with the following command:

```bash
poetry install
```

### Step 4: Install Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks help to catch issues before code is committed to the repository. Install the pre-commit package and set up the pre-commit hooks with the following commands:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## üî¨ Parsing Layout

### üéØ Objective

The objective of this script is to process images and parse it in columns and lines using a model trained with the ARU-Net architecture. The script takes as input a set of images, generate from each page an XML file then processes the XML file to extract bounding boxes (bboxes), and saves these bboxes as separate images. It also provides an option to visualize the bboxes on the original images.

### üõ†Ô∏è How it works

The script works in the following steps:

1. **Configuration**: The script reads a configuration file (`config.json`) to set up the parameters for the ARU-Net model and other processing steps.

2. **Model Setup**: The ARU-Net model is created and set up using the parameters from the configuration file.

3. **Data Loading**: The script loads the images to be processed.

4. **Model Application**: The script applies the ARU-Net model to the loaded images and saves the corresponding XML files that identify lines of texts.

5. **Bbox Extraction**: The script parses the XML files to extract columns and in each column the bbox coordinates. It then resizes and splits the bboxes according to the column they belong to.

6. **Bbox Saving**: Each bbox is cropped from the original image and saved as a separate image in a specified directory. The bboxes are organized by the column they belong to.

7. **Visualization**: If the verbose option is enabled, the script displays the original images with the bboxes drawn on them.

### üìú How to apply the script

To apply the script, you need to have a set of images and corresponding XML files containing bbox information. You also need to have a trained ARU-Net model saved as a `.tar` file.

You can run the script from the command line with the following arguments:

- `--PATH_PAGES`: Path to the directory containing the images.
- `--PATH_MODELS`: Path to the directory containing the model file.
- `--PATH_XML`: Path to the directory containing the XML files.
- `--PATH_LINES`: Path to the directory where the bbox images will be saved.
- `--verbose`: (Optional) If set to `True`, the script will display the images with the bboxes drawn on them.

Example command:

```bash
python trocr_handwritten/parse/parse_page.py --PATH_PAGES /path/to/images --PATH_MODELS /path/to/model --PATH_XML /path/to/xml --PATH_LINES /path/to/save/bbox/images --verbose True
```
